# React Best Practices

## Components: functional and pure

- **Functional components only**: Use function components; avoid class components. Hooks are only available in functions.
- **Purity**: Components must be pure: same props/state/context → same output. No side effects during render; no mutating non-local values. Put side effects in event handlers or `useEffect`.
- **Single responsibility**: One clear purpose per component; split when a component does too much. Prefer composition over large, multi-concern components.

## Rules of Hooks

- **Top level only**: Call hooks only at the top level of a component or custom hook—not inside loops, conditions, nested functions, or try/catch.
- **From React only**: Call hooks only from function components or custom hooks, not from plain JS functions.
- Use **eslint-plugin-react-hooks** to enforce these rules.

## State and data

- **Lift state** to the lowest common ancestor that needs it; avoid storing state higher than necessary.
- **Derived state**: Prefer computing derived values during render (or with `useMemo` only when the computation is expensive and dependencies are stable). Avoid storing derived state in state when it can be computed.
- **Immutability**: Do not mutate props or state; update with new objects/arrays (spread, map, filter, etc.) so React can detect changes.

## Composition

- **Children and slots**: Prefer passing React elements as `children` or named props (e.g. `header`, `footer`) instead of prop drilling. Intermediate components stay dumb and layout-focused.
- **Compound components**: When several subcomponents share internal state, group them (e.g. with context) but expose a declarative API so the consumer composes the pieces they need.
- **Containment**: Use composition (children, render props, or slots) instead of config objects that duplicate the DOM structure.

## Effects (useEffect)

- **Side effects only**: Use `useEffect` for sync with external systems, subscriptions, or DOM; not for transforming props into state (prefer derived values or reset in render).
- **Dependencies**: List all reactive values used inside the effect in the dependency array; avoid lying about dependencies to satisfy the linter.
- **Cleanup**: Return a cleanup function when the effect sets up subscriptions, timers, or listeners so they are removed on unmount or when dependencies change.
- **Avoid effects for derived data**: If the effect only updates state from props, consider computing during render or using a key to reset state when identity changes.

## Performance

- **Measure first**: Use React DevTools Profiler (or similar) before adding memoization; optimize only when there is a measurable problem.
- **useMemo**: Use when a calculation is expensive and dependencies are stable; avoid for cheap computations or when dependencies change every render.
- **useCallback**: Use when passing a callback to a **memoized** child (React.memo) and the callback identity would cause unnecessary re-renders; or when the callback is a dependency of useEffect/useMemo. Do not use by default for every handler.
- **React.memo**: Use for components that re-render often with the same props; skip for components that almost always get new props or are cheap to render.
- **Code splitting**: Use `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for route-level or heavy components to reduce initial bundle size.

## Lists and keys

- **Stable keys**: Use a unique, stable id (e.g. from data) for list items. Do not use array index as key when the list can reorder, filter, or insert items—it can cause bugs and wrong reuse.
- **Key placement**: Put the key on the outermost element returned in the list (e.g. on the component you map, not on a wrapper fragment without key).

## Accessibility

- **Semantic HTML**: Use correct elements (`button`, `nav`, `main`, `label`, etc.); avoid div/span for interactive or structural roles when a native element exists.
- **ARIA when needed**: Use ARIA attributes when the default semantics are not enough (e.g. `aria-label`, `aria-expanded`, `role`); prefer native semantics first.
- **Focus**: Ensure keyboard focus order and visible focus (e.g. `:focus-visible`); do not remove outline without a visible replacement. Trap focus in modals when appropriate.
- **Forms**: Associate labels with inputs (`htmlFor`/`id`); report validation errors accessibly.

## React 19 and Server Components (when applicable)

- **Server Components**: Use for static or server-fetched content; no hooks or browser APIs. Fetch data with async/await in the component when the framework supports it.
- **Client Components**: Add `"use client"` only where needed (hooks, event handlers, browser APIs). Keep the client boundary as low as possible to reduce bundle size.
- **Server Actions**: Mark server-side mutation functions with `'use server'` at the top of the file or function; validate and authorize all arguments. Prefer calling them from forms or inside `useTransition`.
- **Frameworks**: Use React 19 with a framework that supports RSC (e.g. Next.js 15+, Remix, React Router 7+) when using Server Components.

## TypeScript (when used)

- Type component props with an interface or type; avoid inline object types for complex props.
- Type hooks (useState, custom hooks) so that initial value and updates are correctly typed; use generics for useState when the value can be null initially.
- Type event handlers (e.g. `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`) instead of `any`.

## Checklist

- [ ] Components are functional and pure; side effects only in handlers or useEffect.
- [ ] Hooks called at top level only; eslint-plugin-react-hooks enabled.
- [ ] State lifted appropriately; no redundant derived state.
- [ ] Composition used (children, compound components) instead of prop drilling or giant components.
- [ ] useMemo/useCallback/React.memo only where profiling shows benefit.
- [ ] List keys are stable and not index when list can change.
- [ ] Semantic HTML and accessibility considered (focus, labels, ARIA if needed).
